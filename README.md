# Enhancing-Customer-Subscription-Rates-using-Machine-Learning-Data-mining-Project
Project Overview
This project, titled "Enhancing Customer Subscription Rates Through Predictive Modeling," focuses on leveraging machine learning and data visualization techniques to improve customer subscription rates for businesses, particularly in the retail sector. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle, the project aims to identify the key factors that influence subscription decisions and develop predictive models to optimize marketing strategies.

Objectives
The primary objective of the project is to create a predictive model that accurately forecasts the likelihood of customers subscribing to a service or product. This model will help businesses:
Increase customer subscription rates through targeted marketing campaigns.
Enhance revenue streams by identifying potential subscribers from existing customers.
Improve customer engagement by understanding and predicting customer behaviors.

Scope
The project encompasses the following activities:
Data Collection: Gathering and consolidating relevant customer data, including demographic details, purchase history, and engagement metrics.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to ensure it is ready for analysis.
Model Development: Applying various machine learning algorithms to predict subscription likelihood, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), and Logistic Regression.
Evaluation: Assessing the models' performance using appropriate metrics and refining them for optimal results.
Deployment: Integrating the predictive model into marketing strategies to enhance decision-making and improve subscription rates.

Key Findings
Discounts and Customer Reviews: Discounts and positive customer reviews were found to significantly impact subscription decisions, indicating that perceived value and customer satisfaction are crucial factors.
Demographic and Behavioral Insights: Specific age groups and purchasing behaviors were identified as more likely to lead to subscriptions, providing valuable information for targeted marketing efforts.
Model Performance: Logistic Regression, particularly after applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), was determined to be the most effective model for predicting subscription likelihood, offering both accuracy and interpretability.
Strategic Recommendations

Based on the project findings, the following strategies are recommended:
Enhance Customer Satisfaction: Focus on improving product quality and customer service to boost satisfaction and subscription rates.
Optimize Discount Strategies: Tailor discounts to customer segments that are most sensitive to pricing, maximizing conversion rates.
Deploy Data-Driven Marketing Campaigns: Use the predictive model to segment customers and develop personalized marketing strategies aimed at increasing subscriptions.

Impact
The project has the potential to significantly improve a business's ability to target potential subscribers, optimize marketing spend, and enhance customer retention. By adopting a data-driven approach, businesses can stay competitive and adapt to changing market conditions more effectively.

This project was a collaborative effort, with contributions from Ananya Shetty and Dhiksha Mathanagopal, both of whom played equal roles in its development and execution. The work was submitted as part of a group assignment for Data Mining Course/Northeastern University.
